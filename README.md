# UW-CSE-461-Computer-Networking-
This is computer networking project

[Project 1](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/20sp/assignments/sockets.html)
- Our program create a client application that will communicate with a UW CSE server using a specific protocol.
It extracts a secret from the server for each stage of the protocol while server validate the answer. 
The client and the server will communicate over UDP as well as TCP sockets.

[Project 2](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/20sp/assignments/mininet.html)
- Learned syntax in mininet,a SDN-enabled network emulator.
- Used POX to build L2 firewall
- Constructed an small network with multiple switches capable of handling ARP and other traffic. 
- Built an actual L3 IP router that handles ARP and routes traffic.

[Project 3](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/20sp/assignments/proxy.html)
- Programmed an HTTP proxy that passes requests and data between multiple web clients and web servers, concurrently. 
- The HTTP proxy is capable of both relaying HTTP requests and HTTP CONNECT tunneling.
